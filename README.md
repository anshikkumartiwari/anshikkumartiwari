Hello! I'm a second year CSE student pursuing B.Tech from VIT Chennai. My journey in programming began during my school days, and the initial thrill of writing code and seeing it come to life, and I knew that programming was the thing for me.

## Languages and Frameworks

- **C**: The language that introduced me to low-level programming and system architecture.
- **C++**: Enhanced my understanding of object-oriented programming and complex data structures.
- **Java**: Currently exploring the intricacies of Java for enterprise-level applications.
- **Flask**: Building lightweight web applications with Python.
- **Django**: Switiching some of web applications from falsk to django and learning.
