## About Me

Hello! I'm a second year CSE student pursuing B.Tech from VIT Chennai. My journey in programming began during my school days, and the initial thrill of writing code and seeing it come to life, and I knew that programming was the thing for me.

## Languages and Frameworks

I consider myself a beginner and am getting my hands on and trying to understand bit of evrything I get a chance to. Though, heres something that I've seriosly worked on.

- **Python**: My primary language for scripting, automation, and web development.
- **C**: The foundation of my understanding of low-level programming and system architecture.
- **C++**: Strengthened my grasp on object-oriented programming and efficient data structures.
- **Java**: Currently exploring its depth and versatility.
- **Flask**: Developing lightweight web applications with Python.
- **HTML & CSS**: Designing responsive and visually appealing web pages.
- **JavaScript & React**: Building interactive and dynamic front-end experiences.
- **Supabase & SQL**: Managing databases efficiently.
- **pandas & scikit-learn**: Working with data manipulation and machine learning.
- **OpenCV & Deep Learning**: Exploring AI-powered computer vision.
- **Git**: Version control to track and manage code efficiently.
